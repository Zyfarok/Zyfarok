Hello there.
I'm French :fr: and a PhD student in Computer Science at EPFL in Switzerland :switzerland:.

As part of my PhD in the Distributed Computing Laboratory, I'm working on low latency and robust distributed systems for today's data centers, often working at the microsecond scale when operating within a single datacenter, or saving every possible millisecond in geo-replication contexts.
I'm particularly interested in subjects related to concurrent and distributed systems, algorithms, databases, and cybersecurity.

In my free time, I'm involved in the community of the open-source rhythm game "osu!", where I occasionally host tournaments and strive to improve tools and algorithms for the game.
I'm also a board member of the osu!frlive association, whose role is to organize and promote french tournaments and rebroadcast international tournaments in french.
