Hello there. I'm Cl√©ment but online, people call me Zyf.
I'm French :fr: and a PhD student in Computer Science at EPFL in Switzerland :switzerland:.

As part of my PhD in the Distributed Computing Laboratory, I'm working on fast and robust distributed systems for today's data centers where network latency is at the microsecond scale.
I'm particularly interested in subjects related to concurrent and distributed systems and algorithms, cybersecurity, and functionnal programming.

In my free time, I'm involved in the community of the open-source rhythm game "osu!", where I occasionally host tournaments and strive to improve tools and algorithms for the game.
I'm also an active director of the osu!frlive association, whose role is to organize and promote french tournaments and rebroadcast international tournaments in french.
